### Code of the Keras for Deep Learning mini course

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. 
It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

Apply Keras for Deep Learning is as easy as prepare a sandwich or for who prefers pasta, it is as easy as prepare a lasagna.
